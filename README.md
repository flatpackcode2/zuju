# Instructions

## Setup
1. Make sure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed on your machine.
2. Run `docker compose up` at the root of this directory. This will set up the db called `zuju_db` and db client `adminer`
3. Ensure that version 18.x of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in installed on your machine.
4. Run `npm i` at the root of this directory to install all required packages.
5. Run `npm run dev` at the root of this directory. This will start the server at (http://localhost:1337)

## Testing and querying
1. You can login to adminer to view and query the db at (http://localhost:8080). The details are as follows:
        - user: root
        - password: mypassword
        - server: zuju_db
        - db: local_db
2. To query the fixtures listing, you may use the [Postman]() and query the server at the following url: `http://localhost:1337/fixture?page=<the page you want to query next>&limit=<number of entries to show in this page>`
3. To run the unit tests, run `npm run test`

This sample project currently does not have any caching aside from the built in caching that mySQL has.
